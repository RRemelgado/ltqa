Code used to calculate LTQA metrics. Here, we see two pieces of code:
1. **map_landsat_quality.py** - Calculates annual metrics.
2. **map_last_year.py** - Uses the outputs of 1 to determine the last year with data, which can range from the year of observation to any year as far back as 1982.

Both pieces of were written with Python 3.1.0, and the file **requirements.txt** lists modules dependecies that can be installed with pip.
